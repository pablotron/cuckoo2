[x] implement hashes from http://www.vak.ru/doku.php/proj/hash/sources
[ ] testing of the speed and distribution of the various hash functions
    (simple timed bucket test with random bytes and words?)
[ ] test of the default cfg parameters
[ ] add perl, python, and ruby hash functions.
[ ] clean up parse.c (separate cuckoo hash into different functions)
[x] bit bias test:
[-] better numbers for distribution test in hash.c
[ ] fix hash_test distribution output
[ ] timing test on amd
[ ] test with binary strings
[ ] better distribution numbers (maybe per-bin size?)
